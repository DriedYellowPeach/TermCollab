## Project Description

This project explores the design of a terminal-native collaboration system for developers, DevOps engineers, and system administrators who work primarily in command-line environments.

When terminal users need to share logs, configuration files, command outputs, or debugging information, they must switch from their terminal to GUI-based communication tools such as Slack or Microsoft Teams. This context-switch disrupts focus, increases cognitive load, and reduces productivity.

Our project investigates how a structured Terminal User Interface (TUI) collaboration tool could reduce workflow interruption while supporting modern team communication needs within the terminal environment.


## Phase 1: Research & Planning

In Phase 1, we conducted extensive background research and structured planning to ground the project in empirical evidence and stakeholder analysis.

Our research focused on:
	•	The cognitive cost of context-switching and workplace interruptions
	•	Developer productivity research emphasizing uninterrupted focus
	•	The fragmentation caused by current collaboration ecosystems
	•	The effectiveness of existing TUI tools (e.g., htop, lazygit, ranger) in improving terminal workflows

We also conducted a market and competitor analysis comparing:
	•	GUI collaboration tools (Slack, Microsoft Teams)
	•	Terminal-based chat tools (WeeChat, irssi)
	•	Terminal session-sharing tools (tmux, tmate)

This analysis revealed a clear gap: while TUI tools have successfully enhanced many terminal workflows, no structured terminal-native solution exists for modern team collaboration.

Additionally, we identified primary, secondary, and indirect stakeholders, including backend developers, DevOps engineers, SREs, system administrators, team leads, and IT security teams. Their goals, constraints, and workflow patterns informed our framing of the problem space.

Finally, we established a structured Design Thinking roadmap (Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test) to guide subsequent phases of user research, concept development, and usability evaluation.

Phase 1 establishes the theoretical foundation, competitive landscape understanding, and strategic direction for future prototyping and testing.
